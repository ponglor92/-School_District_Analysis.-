# -School_District_Analysis.-
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
- The purpose of this school district analysis project was to replace the reading and math scores for Thomas high school. Along with that, I had to repeat the school district analysis that was done in module 4, and write a written report how these changes affect the analysis , over all.
## Results
# How is the district summary affceted
- When 9th reading and math scores were removed in Thomas high school in the data set, the numnber of total school and students were not affected. The avereage math score from the district decreased to 78.9, which is reduced by 0.001%.

# How is the school summary affected?
- The school summary was not affected much, because it changed only when Thomas High School changed itself because we used the percentage of math scores and reading scores, along with total number of students at each school. 
# How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
- With the original data set that was used, in the Top 5 Schools, the overall passing score for Thomas High School was 90.9. When the scores were removed from the data set, the score dropped to 65.6 which is over a 30% drop.

# How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
